              Facts About Camels:
              Camels have thick lips which let them forage for thorny plants other animals can't eat.
              Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows of eyelashes to keep sand out of their eyes.
              There are two types of camels: One humped or “dromedary” camels and two humped Bactrian camels.
